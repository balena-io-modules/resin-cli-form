Resin.io CLI form interpreter.

Role
----

The intention of this module is to provide an interpreter for our internal declarative form definitions.

Installation
------------

Install `resin-cli-form` by running:

```sh
$ npm install --save resin-cli-form
```

Documentation
-------------

{{#module name="form"}}
{{>body~}}
{{>member-index~}}
{{>separator~}}
{{>members~}}
{{/module}}

When
----

We use a `when` property to determine the conditions needed for a question to be asked. This property consists of an object determining the value name (as key), and the value it must have (as value) for the condition to hold. A `when` property can depend on one or more answers, by having many key value pairs.

Example:

```coffee
form.run [
	message: 'Network Type'
	name: 'network'
	type: 'list'
	choices: [ 'ethernet', 'wifi' ]
,
	message: 'Wifi Ssid'
	name: 'wifiSsid'
	type: 'input'
	when:
		network: 'wifi'
,
	message: 'Wifi Key'
	name: 'wifiKey'
	type: 'input'
	when:
		network: 'wifi'
]
```

In this case, the wifi ssid and wiki key will only be asked if the network type is `wifi`.
